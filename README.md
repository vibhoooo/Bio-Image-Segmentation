## Introduction
Semantic Image Segmentation for Melanoma Detection using U-Net Architecture

## Tech Stack
• Python <br />
• Numpy <br />
• Pandas <br />
• MatplotLib <br />
• PyTorch 

## Salient Features
• Worked under the supervision of Professor Sudeshna Mondal, as part of a three-member team to conduct a comparative study of the three variations of the U-Net architecture: Normal U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Transformer U-Net leveraging the ISIC 2017 dataset comprising of 2000 skin lesion images with corresponding superpixel masks for Melanoma detection. <br />
• Conducted 100-epoch training sessions, benchmarking and achieving significant improvements in performance metrics for melanoma detection. <br />
• Achieved peak performance with the Normal U-Net model, attaining a Jaccard score of 84.30%, Dice score of 94.46%, Sensitivity of 98.85% and Specificity of 94.85%. <br />
